# Spec module for Puppet

**Evaluate assertions during a Puppet run**

This module is provided by [Camptocamp](http://www.camptocamp.com/)


## Requirements

This module requires the following Ruby libraries:

* `rspec`;
* [`rspec-puppet`](https://github.com/rodjek/rspec-puppet) for catalog tests;
* [`serverspec`](https://github.com/mizzy/serverspec) (&gt;= 2.0.0) for functional tests.


## Using catalog spec termini

This module provides new Puppet termini which allow to evaluate rspec tests on the actual compiled catalog.

In order to install these termini:

* Run Puppet with `pluginsync` on to copy the indirectors;
* Set your `$confdir/routes.yaml` to use the termini, for example:

        agent:
          catalog:
            terminus: rest_spec
            cache: yaml
        master:
          catalog:
            terminus: compiler_spec

### `rest_spec` terminus

The `rest_spec` terminus extends the `rest` terminus for catalogs. After retrieving the catalog using the `rest` terminus, it applies rspec tests to it:

* The rspec tests must be located in `:libdir/spec/catalog/class` (allowing you to deploy them via `pluginsync` by putting them in the module's `lib/spec/catalog/class` directory), in sub-directories by class;
* Only the directories named after classes declared in the catalog will be tested;
* `rspec-puppet` matchers are already loaded, so they are available in tests;
* The catalog is exported as a shared instance of the PuppetSpec::Catalog class and can be loaded as subject with:

        subject { PuppetSpec::Catalog.instance.catalog }

Sample output:

    # puppet agent -t
    info: Retrieving plugin
    err: Could not retrieve catalog from remote server: Unit tests failed:
    F..
    
    Failures:
    
      1) package 
         Failure/Error: it { should contain_package('augeas') }
           expected that the catalogue would contain Package[augeas]

    Finished in 0.00092 seconds
    3 examples, 1 failure
    
    Failed examples:

    info: Not using expired catalog for foo.example.com from cache; expired at Tue Apr 02 17:40:21 +0200 2013
    notice: Using cached catalog


### `compiler_spec` terminus

The `compiler_spec` terminus extends the `compiler` terminus for catalogs. After retrieving the catalog using the `compiler` terminus, it applies rspec tests to it:

* The rspec tests must be located in `:manifestdir/../spec/catalog/class`, in sub-directories by class;
* Only the directories named after classes declared in the catalog will be tested;
* `rspec-puppet` matchers are already loaded, so they are available in tests;
* The catalog is exported as a shared instance of the PuppetSpec::Catalog class and can be loaded as subject with:

        subject { PuppetSpec::Catalog.instance.catalog }

Sample output:

    # puppet agent -t --environment rpinson

    info: Retrieving plugin
    err: Could not retrieve catalog from remote server: Error 400 on SERVER: Unit tests failed:

    rspec /home/rpinson/puppetmaster/spec/catalog/class/foo.example.com/fail_spec.rb:2 # failure 
    notice: Using cached catalog


## Using the functional spec terminus

After the catalog has been tested and applied, you might want to run functional tests against the machine. This module provides a `rest_spec` terminus for the report indirector which executes rspec tests using the `serverspec` matchers.

In order to use it:

* The rspec tests must be located in `:libdir/spec/server/class` (allowing you to deploy them via `pluginsync`) or `:vardir/spec/server/class` (tests can be deployed using the `spec::serverspec` define), in sub-directories by class;
* `serverspec` matchers are already loaded, so they are available in tests.

To activate the terminus, you need set it in `$confdir/routes.yaml`:

    agent:
      report:
        terminus: rest_spec

Sample output:

    # puppet agent  -t
    info: Retrieving plugin
    info: Caching catalog for foo.example.com
    info: Applying configuration version 'raphink/a2c8e0f [+]'
    ... Applying changes ...

         Failure/Error: it { should be_file }
           expected "/usr/share/augeas/lenses/dist" to be file

         # /var/lib/puppet/lib/puppet/indirector/report/rest_spec.rb:45:in `save'
    
    Finished in 0.06033 seconds
    2 examples, 2 failures
    
    Failed examples:
    
    rspec /var/lib/puppet/lib/spec/server/class/foo.example.com/package_spec.rb:2 # augeas

This indirector will automatically generate serverspec tests from the catalog for known resource types, making the catalog self-asserting. Currently, it supports the following resource types:

* Package
* Service
* File
* User


## Using the MCollective agent

This module provides an MCollective agent in `files/mcollective/agent`. This agent currently has two actions:
